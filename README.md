# ionic-vue

Have you ever wanted to use Ionic with other frameworks than Angular? Now you can! Ionic 4 is in early alpha, so the implementation is likely to change as time goes on... but here it is anyway!

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
